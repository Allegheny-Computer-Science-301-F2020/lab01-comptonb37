- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Game companies are using telemetry to try and recognize user patterns and predict 
   expected behavior of their clients.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - User data could be distributed by these game companies to other malicious users.
    

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Data from public user profiles including playtime, games played, total games owned or
   bought with no playtime, title and genre of games, and the game developers are being 
   taken and analyzed. 

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - 500 players' 3 million comprised hours of playtime of games in their steam library 
   is being analyzed. The data is then sorted into clusters of game clusters based on 
   genres including action, small inventory, simulations, conpetitive, and mixed. Each 
   cluster's playtime was taken and analyzed for amount of playtime compared to other
   genres and what games within the genre are the most played. Each have uniquely 
   interesting results that shows what the audience shows the most interest in and 
   potentially draws a parallel of what genre people that have the most time on their hands
   choose to play - the answer seems to be siulations such as Arma and Garry's mod.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The game companies would gain knowledge of what their users cling onto in terms of 
   game format or style so they can better cater to their audience.
   The data could also be outsourced to malicious users wishing to track naive users 
   whose data is being analyzed that did not decide to hide their profile and thus 
   are essentially doxing themselves based on how much they shared about themselves.
