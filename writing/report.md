### Article 1
# Article name.
 - Clustering steam user behavior data using -Prototypes algorithm

##### Reference or article citation.
 - https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/725/1/012105/pdf

##### Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Game companies are using telemetry to try and recognize user patterns and predict 
   expected behavior of their clients.

##### What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - User data could be distributed by these game companies to other malicious users.
    

##### What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Data from public user profiles including playtime, games played, total games owned or
   bought with no playtime, title and genre of games, and the game developers are being 
   taken and analyzed. 

##### Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - 500 players' 3 million comprised hours of playtime of games in their steam library 
   is being analyzed. The data is then sorted into clusters of game clusters based on 
   genres including action, small inventory, simulations, conpetitive, and mixed. Each 
   cluster's playtime was taken and analyzed for amount of playtime compared to other
   genres and what games within the genre are the most played. Each have uniquely 
   interesting results that shows what the audience shows the most interest in and 
   potentially draws a parallel of what genre people that have the most time on their hands
   choose to play - the answer seems to be siulations such as Arma and Garry's mod.

##### Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The game companies would gain knowledge of what their users cling onto in terms of 
   game format or style so they can better cater to their audience.
   The data could also be outsourced to malicious users wishing to track naive users 
   whose data is being analyzed that did not decide to hide their profile and thus 
   are essentially doxing themselves based on how much they shared about themselves.


### Article 2
##### Article name.
 - Data portability effects on data-driven innovation of online platforms: Analyzing
   Spotify

##### Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030859612030118X

##### Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The EU recently introduced the right for users to move personal data across platforms
   potentially creating a pseudo-monopoly on an industry with the best product and killing
   competition. This article analyzes Spotify specifically as a music streaming platform, and 
   how they expect this company to respond to this new regulation.

##### What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The fact that data can be so easily transferred between companies allows for malicious use of 
   the data if the company at a disadvantage chooses to use the data in that way. Assuming the data
   is archived, the fact that it "moved" shouldn't necessarily mean it was lost to the original
   company.

##### What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Data for this analysis was collected from Spotify's financial statement to the US Security and 
   Exchange Commision in 2018. Financial information regarding Spotify was specifically considered
   so that a possible correlation could be drawn before and after the regulation of data portability 
   was passed.

##### Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Upon analysis of data regarding Spotify's financial situation and influence in multiple countries 
   compared to other music platforms, the writers of this article came to four possible conclusions.
   The first of these claims that data portability could cause decreased switching costs between platforms 
   in the market, a positive change for a healthy market. The second claim states that Spotify may invest in
   AI or other methods of retaining users by engaging them more actively. The third claim believes that 
   platforms like Spotify will invest in data-driven innovation to better record the new users they are 
   gaining from other companies. The final claim says that companies like Facebook or Google that have
   no major threat to their influence will not be affected by this change. I believe all of these are 
   good assumptions based on what a healthy market would do to accomodate for this new data portability
   change.
   
##### Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The companies in the music streaming industry can gain much from this data to create a more competitive
   market by seeing which companies get the best (monetary) results from its users. These companies could possibly 
   model their business (whether it be UI  off of these successful companies but with enough of a twist on the 
   general idea that they can claim it is their own to avoid being sued. 
   That last comment may bring up an argument that the industry may become incredible similar so, even though there
   is competition and users will have a preference of which company to choose, the differences between them may be so
   miniscule that further legal action regarding "who made the model first" may come into play.
